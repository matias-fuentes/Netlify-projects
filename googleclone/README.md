# [Google Clone](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/#search)

Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

A clone website of the Google search engine. Do absolutely all what you can do in your default Google search webpage,
but with our own clone.

Do search queries, use the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, search for images only, and do advanced search queries! All
functional!

You won't note the difference!

## Background

Recall from lecture that we can create an HTML form using a `<form>` tag and can add `<input>` tags to create input
fields for that form. Later in the course, we'll see how to write web applications that can accept form data as input.
For this project, we'll write forms that send data to an existing web server: in this case, Google's.

When you perform a Google search, as by typing in a query into Google's homepage and clicking the "Google Search"
button, how does that query work? Let's try to find out.

Navigate to [google.com](https://www.google.com/), type in a query like "Harvard" into the search field, and click the
"Google Search" button.

As you probably expected, you should see Google search results for "Harvard." But now, take a look at the URL. It should
begin with `https://www.google.com/search`, the route on Google's website that allows for searching. But following the
route is a `?`, followed by some additional information.

Those additional pieces of information in the URL are known as a query string. The query string consists of a sequence
of GET parameters, where each parameter has a name and a value. Query strings are generally formatted as

```
field1=value1&field2=value2&field3=value3...
```

where an `=` separates the name of the parameter from its value, and the `&` symbol separates parameters from one
another. These parameters are a way for forms to submit information to a web server, by encoding the form data in the
URL.

Take a look at the URL for your Google search results page. It seems there are quite a few parameters that Google is
using. Look through the URL (it may be helpful to copy/paste it into a text editor), and see if you can find any mention
of "Harvard," our query.

If you look through the URL, you should see that one of the GET parameters in the URL is `q=Harvard`. This suggests that
the name for the parameter corresponding to a Google search is `q` (likely short for "query").

It turns out that, while the other parameters provide useful data to Google, only the `q` parameter is required to
perform a search. You can test this for yourself by visiting `https://www.google.com/search?q=Harvard`, deleting all the
other parameters. You should see the same Google results!

Using this information, we can actually re-implement a front end for Google's homepage. Paste the below into an HTML
file called `index.html`, and open it in a browser.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form action="https://google.com/search">
            <input type="text" name="q">
            <input type="submit" value="Google Search">
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

When you open this page in a browser, you should see a (very simple) HTML form. Type in a search query like "Harvard"
and click "Google Search", and you should be taken to Google's search results page!

How did that work? In this case, the `action` attribute on the `form` told the browser that when the form is submitted,
the data should be sent to `https://google.com/search`. And by adding an `input` field to the form
whose `name` attribute was `q`, whatever the user types into that input field is included as a GET parameter in the URL.

Your task in this project is to expand on this site, creating your own front end for Google Search, as by exploring
Google's interface to identify what GET parameters it expects and adding the necessary HTML and CSS to your website.

## Getting Started

-   Download the distribution code from <https://cdn.cs50.net/web/2020/spring/projects/0/search.zip> and unzip it.

## Specification

Your website must meet the following requirements.

-   Pages. Your website should have at least three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one
    for Google Advanced Search.
    -   On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or
        Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google
        Search.
-   Query Text. On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click "Google Search", and be
    taken to the Google search results for that page.
    -   Like Google's own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be
        centered, and should be beneath the search bar.
-   Query Images. On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button,
    and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
-   Query Advanced. On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four
    fields (taken from Google's own [advanced search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search) options)
    -   Find pages with... "all these words:"
    -   Find pages with... "this exact word or phrase:"
    -   Find pages with... "any of these words:"
    -   Find pages with... "none of these words:"
-   Appearance. Like Google's own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the
    text fields should be left aligned.
    -   Consistent with Google's own CSS, the "Advanced Search" button should be blue with white text. When the
        "Advanced Search" button is clicked, the user should be taken to search results page for their given query.
-   Lucky. Add an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google's own behavior,
    clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal
    results page.
-   Aesthetics. The CSS you write should match Google's own aesthetics as best as possible.

## How to Submit

Hold on! If you have already submitted and received a passing grade on
the [prior version of Project 0](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/0/project0.html) (Homepage), please stop
here. You already have received an equivalence credit for this project, and you should not submit this assignment, as it
will have no impact on your progress in the course and will therefore only slow our graders down!

1.  Visit [this link](https://submit.cs50.io/invites/89679428401548238ceb022f141b9947), log in with your GitHub account,
    and click Authorize cs50. Then, check the box indicating that you'd like to grant course staff access to your
    submissions, and click Join course.
2.  [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and,
    optionally, [install `submit50`](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/submit50/).

When you submit your project, the contents of your `web50/projects/2020/x/search` branch should match the file structure
of the unzipped distribution code as originally received. That is to say, your files should not be nested inside of any
other directories of your own creation (`search` or `project0`, for example). Your branch should also not contain any
code from any other projects, only this one. Failure to adhere to this file structure will likely result in your
submission being rejected.

By way of example, for this project that means that if the grading staff
visits `https://github.com/me50/USERNAME/blob/web50/projects/2020/x/search/index.html` (where `USERNAME` is your own
GitHub username as provided in the form, below) your submission for `index.html` for this project should be what
appears. If it doesn't, reorganize your repository as needed to match this paradigm.

1.  If you've installed `submit50`, execute

    ```
    submit50 web50/projects/2020/x/search
    ```

    Otherwise, using Git, push your work to `https://github.com/me50/USERNAME.git`, where `USERNAME` is your GitHub
    username, on a branch called `web50/projects/2020/x/search`.

2.  [Record a screencast](https://www.howtogeek.com/205742/how-to-record-your-windows-mac-linux-android-or-ios-screen/) not
    to exceed 5 minutes in length, in which you demonstrate your project's functionality. Your URL bar must remain
    visible throughout your demonstration of the project. Be certain that every element of the specification, above, is
    demonstrated in your video. There's no need to show your code in this video, just your application in action; we'll
    review your code on GitHub. [Upload that video to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/upload) (as unlisted or public,
    but not private) or somewhere else. In your video's description, you must timestamp where your video demonstrates
    each of the seven (7) elements of the specification. This is not optional, videos without timestamps in their
    description will be automatically rejected.
3.  Submit [this form](https://forms.cs50.io/fb9a6c81-e17d-4a28-be39-1117e4227ea2).

You can then go to <https://cs50.me/cs50w> to view your current progress!

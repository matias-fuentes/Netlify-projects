# [Refokus Challenge](https://refokuschallenge.netlify.app/)

Video Presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTsKAstZsGg

For this challenge, I created two tools: a filter tool, and a filler tool.

With the filter tool, you'll be able to search and filter by your favourite Pokémons (yes, those lovely creatures of
your childhood). Search for ANY (and when I mean ANY, I mean ANY) Pokémon that you want, and filter by its stats,
combining them in any crazy order that you can imagine!

And with the filler tool, you can quote practically any company stock that you want! And of course, get all the details
about it.

## Privacy

Due to the nature of the confidentiality of the application processes, and of course for a matter of respect and
morality, I'm not able to show the coding challenge exercises that the company sent to me, so no details or links
regarding the coding challenge at all.

However, what I can really do it's just show what I did, which is precisely what I'm doing in this repository. Hope you
enjoy it! :).

                        without feeling entirely satisfied, I have decided to go
                        a little further, in order to turn it into part of my
                        own portfolio! Like a kind of CV, but with style~

                        I have been in front of a computer since I was just

                        so big and complex as an, I don't know, an Artificial
                        Intelligence with a deep neural network to make cars
                        full self-driving. Things like that drives me crazy! And
                        precisely by things like that, it's why I just simply
                        love being a programmer &lt3, and have planned to learn

                        I would like, often I try to figure it out by myself
                        what I'm doing wrong, and what can I do about it. If I
                        can't handle it by myself, I turn to the help on those
                        that I trust, and that I know that they can give me a
                        hand. And if someone is bothered by something that I've
                        done or whatever,

                            I've been here when I was a little younger for like,
                            four years, and, it was amazing! They've teached me
                            a lot of things that I actually know about the
                            English language. I had to leave it due to the jump
                            to high school, due to the little time available
                            that I had I preferred to spend it with my friends,
                            and, mainly, due to financial problems. If it hadn't
                            been because I came to this institute, I probably
                            never had the chance to study at Harvard, since
                            everything is in English, so... I'm really in debt
                            with them. Hopefully I can finish my last year, and
                            get graduated!

Maximilian Schwarzmüller it's one of the teachers of Academind, an online YouTube academy for web programmers with almost 1M suscribers! Maximilian it's the best instructor I've ever had, and with his teachings I've been able to learn, absorb, and master the last technologies that the actual market demands. I wish I had met him before. However, this is only the first step to learn a wide range of languages and technologies, and, hopefully, learn with his teachings!

                        Very rough. Obviously I could not study in a
                        presencial way (due to the Coronavirus, location,
                        and, welp, money), but at least I can say that I
                        fulfilled my wish of study in the university of my
                        dreams. The notes, the videos, the projects, even
                        the online classes!! It was incredible to be there
                        and be part of the class! Despite the fact that the
                        online classes didn't have the same essence and
                        closeness that it would surely have if everything
                        had been given in person, I learned. A lot. And take
                        part of study groups, and... I don't know, the
                        experience was simply enriching. In every way.
